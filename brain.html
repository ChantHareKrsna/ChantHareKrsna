With todays current barrage of information whether from cellphones, advertisments etc. The brain has a hard time coping with this information. This has led to stress, anxiety, mental sicknesses, and other maladies. Chanting Hare Krsna is a proven cure that can be used at anytime, anwhere as proven with the studies below.<br><br><br>

According to Dr Baluja, “the data showed that the brain is not actually restful in the so-called resting state.” “Your brain continues to constantly give you information. After chanting, however, the data showed almost no cortical activation, or brain activity. This is very interesting, because it shows that you’ve actually been able to calm down the brain.”, Dr Baluja observed.

“”This data shows the brain at rest. Notice that it does not actually look so restful. There is activation of sending areas (red) and receiving areas (green)

What’s groundbreaking about this is that according to Vinaya, the only method doctors currently have of decreasing such brain activity is anti-epileptic medication. This is used as a therapeutic measure to treat patients with anxiety, schizophrenia, and other such mental disorders.
<br><br>
“Voluntarily decreasing your brain activity is unheard of,” he says. “But our findings show that we can create the same therapeutic effects of medication by chanting the Hare Krishna maha-mantra. That’s very exciting.”

Here we see the brain after four rounds of the Pancha-tattva mantra and 30 minutes of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra. Notice the decreased activation in the brain, and more rest than in the ‘resting state’

Dr Viveck Baluja says that the findings also correlate with the model Lord Krishna gives in the third chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, where He says “one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence.”
<br><br>
“The data showed that in the back of the brain in the area of the Cerebellum – which is associated with fine tuning and balance, and is under more automatic activation – there was more control and more stimulation after chanting,” he explains.
<br><br>

During chanting, lower amplitudes are seen in the central and frontal regions of the brain. But higher amplitudes are seen in posterior channels, which may reflect more activity in the cerebellum.

Vinaya says that this has piqued the interest of members of the Henry Ford Hospital Institutional Review Board, who have approved the study of ten more subjects to gather more data and further validate his findings.

This study will develop baseline scientific proof of the effects of chanting on the brain.
