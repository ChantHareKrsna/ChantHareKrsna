<p><font size=+3> The simple process of Chanting
<br>is the sublime method of awakening our Krsna Consciousness.</a>(Inner Happiness) <font><br><br>

    <blockquote>  The transcendental vibration established by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the sublime method for reviving our transcendental consciousness. As living spiritual souls, we are all originally Kṛṣṇa conscious entities, but due to our association with matter from time immemorial, our consciousness is now adulterated by the material atmosphere. The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called māyā, or illusion. Māyā means “that which is not.” And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, he is said to be in illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare is the transcendental process for reviving this original, pure consciousness. By chanting this transcendental vibration, we can cleanse away all misgivings within our hearts.</blockquote>

<br><b>It's very simple to begin practice. </b>Try to chant the mantra as many times as you can. It can be done sitting and focusing on the words or it can literally be chanted anywhere at anytime. Ideally it is good to be consistent and make it a daily practice. This can be done by chanting the mantra in full 108 times. This equals one round. The idea is to try to get as many rounds done in a day as possible .One round should take you around 5-10 minutes but don't worry sometimes the first few rounds may take longer! Don't rush it, instead relish it!<br><br><br>

<b>What does each word in the mantra mean?</b> Each word in this mantra Hare, Krishna and Rama are addressing the different energies of The Supreme Personality of Godhead. some refer to these energies collectively as a Higher Energy, All Pervasive Positivity, The All Attractive or Inner Happiness. By addressing these different energies we are associating directly with these higher qualities and therefore imbibe them into our consciousness; hence purifying our consciousness and restoring it to it's  original balance. This creates complete peace in our minds and happiness in our hearts.<br><br>

<b>This Mantra was designed with the Modern Individual in Mind. . .</b>
<blockquote> The maha-mantra was prescribed for modern times because of the fast-paced nature of things today. Even when people do get into a little quiet place, it’s very difficult to calm the mind for very long.
<br><br>
Chanting Hare Krishna is a type of meditation that can be practiced even if the mind is in turbulence. You can even be doing it and other things at the same time. That’s what’s so nice. In my life there’s been many times the mantra brought things around. It keeps me in tune with reality, and the more you sit in one place and chant. . . the more you purify the vibration, the more you can achieve what you’re trying to do<br><br>- George Harrison from The Beatles<br></blockquote>

It gets you feeling a bit invincible. The funny thing was that I didn't even know where I was going. I mean I had bought a map, and I knew basically which way I was aiming, but I couldn't speak French, Spanish, or Portuguese. But none of that seemed to matter. You know, once you get chanting, then things start to happen transcendentally. Chanting Hare Krishna is really the same sort of thing as meditation, but I think it has a quicker effect.<b> -George Harrison </b></blockquote> </td>

<font size="+3"> <b>Peter Sellers and George Harrison - Plane In An Electric Storm </b></font><br><br><br>
“Once I was on an aeroplane that was in an electric storm,” George explained. “It was hit by lightning three times, and a Boeing 707 went over the top of us, missing by inches.
<br><br>
“I thought the back end of the plane had blown off. I was on my way from Los Angeles to New York to organise the Bangladesh concert. As soon as the plane began bouncing around, I started chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
<br><br>
“The whole thing went on for about an hour and a half or two hours, the plane dropping hundreds of feet and bouncing all over in the storm, all the lights out and all these explosions, and everybody terrified.
<br><br>
“I ended up with my feet pressed against the seat in front, my seat belt as tight as it could be, gripping on the thing, and yelling Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare at the top of my voice. I know for me, the difference between making it and not making it was actually chanting the mantra. Peter Sellers also swore that chanting Hare Krishna saved him from a plane crash once.”
