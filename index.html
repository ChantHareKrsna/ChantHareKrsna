<font size=+3>A Practical Meditation</font>
<br><br><br>
<blockquote><b>Mukunda:</b> The maha-mantra was prescribed for modern times because of the fast-paced nature of things today. Even when people do get into a little quiet place, it’s very difficult to calm the mind for very long.
<br><br>
<b>George Harrison:</b> That’s right. Chanting Hare Krishna is a type of meditation that can be practiced even if the mind is in turbulence. You can even be doing it and other things at the same time. That’s what’s so nice. In my life there’s been many times the mantra brought things around. It keeps me in tune with reality, and the more you sit in one place and chant. . . the more you purify the vibration, the more you can achieve what you’re trying to do<br><br><br></blockquote>

    <font size="+2">Some Quotes From More Prominent Practicioners </font>
    <blockquote>Once I chanted the Hare Krishna mantra all the way from France to Portugal, nonstop. I drove for about twenty-three hours and chanted all the way. It gets you feeling a bit invincible. The funny thing was that I didn't even know where I was going. I mean I had bought a map, and I knew basically which way I was aiming, but I couldn't speak French, Spanish, or Portuguese. But none of that seemed to matter. You know, once you get chanting, then things start to happen transcendentally. <b> -George Harrison </b></blockquote>

    <blockquote>Chanting Hare Krishna is really the same sort of thing as meditation, but I think it has a quicker effect. I mean, even if you put your beads down, you can still say the mantra or sing it without actually keeping track on your beads. <b>-George Harrison</b></blockquote>

    <blockquote>No matter how much money you've got, it doesn't necessarily make you happy. You have to find your happiness with the problems you have, not worry too much about them, and chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. - George Harrison</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Everything started happening for me when I started Chanting Hare Krsna! <b> -Jean Claude (Youngest Ever Director of 3M Inc. in France)</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>By Starting to Chant Hare Krishna, I feel tremendous Happiness" - Vicki Overton (European Lead Model)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I've been chanting Hare Krishna for many years, and I can't find anything more pleasurable - N.D Desai (Indian Industrialist)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Chanting Hare Krsna has made a tremendous Impact on my life .  - Alfred Ford (Grandson to Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company)</blockquote>
><br><br>
<blockquote>“This chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra is enacted from the spiritual platform and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciouness – namely sensual, mental and intellectual.” <br><br><b>A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada</b> </blockquote>
<br><br>
Currently being practiced and Taught at Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Brigham Young, CalTech, Georgia Tech and many other Universities. It's also used extensively in Silicon Valley.
