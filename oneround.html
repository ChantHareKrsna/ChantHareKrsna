	<font size=+4>Chant Hare Krsna - One Round </font>
<br><br>
	<b>Points to remember</b><br><br>
	1. Only Listen TO Bona-Fide Sources for Hearing the Maha Mantra. Listening to un-bonafide sources or those that aren't in the stage of complete prema in a purely spiritually mood will damage your practice and can hurt your consciousness. I suggest listening only to chanting that is present on this site. 
	<br>2. Remain as focused as possible for one round. Other rounds you do can be done even while accomplishing other tasks. This will allow you to become more familiar with the chanting and still help enhance your one round practice. YOu can have this maha mantra played full time in your house softly in the background to purify the energy and create a positive uplifitng environment. Chanting along with will increase the power and give you even more benefit.
	<br>
	3. Doing more than one round is encouraged but not mandatory.
	<br>4. Maya is the sankskrit term for illusion. Illusion is anything and anyone that deviates us from the path of chanting pure suddha nama or pure chanting of Hare Krsna maha mantra. This can sometimes come in the form of doubts in the mind. We must expect and be prepared for such instances. These are tests that when persevered through will make you climb the spiritual ladder faster. Distractions and excuses for not chanting also fall under this umbrella of Maya. The best way to counteract maya is to chant Hare Krsna and ask questions to senior chanters.

	And to conclude . . . <br><br>
	The best method of chanting is :
<br><br>

<i>tṛṇād api sunīcena <br>
taror api sahiṣṇunā<br>
amāninā mānadena<br>
kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ<br></i><br><br>
“One can chant in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant constantly.” (Śikṣāṣṭaka 3)<br>
